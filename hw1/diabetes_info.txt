3. Description
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

4. Format:
The dataset for this homework is a data frame with 536 cases (rows) and 9 variables (columns) named Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and Outcome.

Pregnancies
	Number of times pregnant

Glucose
	Glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure
	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness
	Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin
	2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI
	Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction
	Diabetes pedigree function

Age
	Age (years)

Outcome
	Class variable (0 or 1). 1 if having diabetes, 0 otherwise.
